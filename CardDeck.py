""" 
    The first thing to note is the use of collections.namedtuple to construct a simple
    class to represent individual cards. We use namedtuple to build classes of objects that
    are just bundles of attributes with no custom methods, like a database record. In the
    example, we use it to provide a nice representation for the cards in the deck, as shown
    in the console session:
